	abstract = {Background: The history of maize has been characterized by major demographic events, including population size changes associated with domestication and range expansion, and gene flow with wild relatives. The interplay between demographic history and selection has shaped diversity across maize populations and genomes.
Results: We investigate these processes using high-depth resequencing data from 31 maize landraces spanning the pre-Columbian distribution of maize, and four wild teosinte individuals (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis). Genome-wide demographic analyses reveal that maize experienced pronounced declines in effective population size due to both a protracted domestication bottleneck and serial founder effects during post-domestication spread, while parviglumis in the Balsas River Valley experienced population growth. The domestication bottleneck and subsequent spread led to an increase in deleterious alleles in the domesticate compared to the wild progenitor. This cost is particularly pronounced in Andean maize, which has experienced a more dramatic founder event compared to other maize populations. Additionally, we detect introgression from the wild teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana into maize in the highlands of Mexico, Guatemala, and the southwestern USA, which reduces the prevalence of deleterious alleles likely due to the higher long-term effective population size of teosinte.
Conclusions: These findings underscore the strong interaction between historical demography and the efficiency of selection and illustrate how domesticated species are particularly useful for understanding these processes. The landscape of deleterious alleles and therefore evolutionary potential is clearly influenced by recent demography, a factor that could bear importantly on many species that have experienced recent demographic shifts.},

Architectural traits included diameters of the nodal root system, individual crown roots, and the stem; numbers of seminal and nodal roots; biomass; and nodal root length and branching. Ranges for anatomical traits were similar for teosintes and landraces, except for aerenchyma and xylem areas, and number of cortical cells. Landraces had greater variation for architectural traits except for nodal root number and branching, and had larger mean stele and xylem areas, longer nodal roots, wider nodal systems, and more seminal roots than teosintes. In contrast, teosintes were smaller but had more nodal roots with greater branching. At a common plant size, teosintes would have lower mean values for all anatomical traits, except for number of cortical cells and cell files. Teosintes had greater scaled values for all architectural traits except average root diameter. Cluster analysis divided accessions into eight root phenotypes. Phenotypic diversity for root traits in the genus Zea could be a valuable resource for improving stress tolerance in maize.},

	abstract = {Landraces are key elements of agricultural biodiversity that have long been considered a source of useful traits. Their importance goes beyond subsistence agriculture and the essential need to preserve genetic diversity, because landraces are farmer-developed populations that are often adapted to environmental conditions of signiﬁcance to tackle environmental concerns. It is therefore increasingly important to identify adaptive traits in crop landraces and understand their molecular basis. This knowledge is potentially useful for promoting more sustainable agricultural techniques, reducing the environmental impact of high-input cropping systems, and diminishing the vulnerability of agriculture to global climate change. In this review, we present an overview of the opportunities and limitations offered by landraces’ genomics. We discuss how rapid advances in DNA sequencing techniques, plant phenotyping, and recombinant DNA-based biotechnology encourage both the identiﬁcation and the validation of the genomic signature of local adaptation in crop landraces. The integration of ‘omics’ sciences, molecular population genetics, and ﬁeld studies can provide information inaccessible with earlier technological tools. Although empirical knowledge on the genetic and genomic basis of local adaptation is still fragmented, it is predicted that genomic scans for adaptation will unlock an intraspeciﬁc molecular diversity that may be different from that of modern varieties.},

Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern of deme · habitat interaction for ﬁtness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of local adaptation – divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene ﬂow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder local adaptation. Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.},

	abstract = {In Mexico’s territory, the center of origin and domestication of maize (Zea mays), there is a large phenotypic diversity of this crop. This diversity has been classiﬁed into “landraces.” Previous studies have reported that genomic variation in Mexican maize is better explained by environmental factors, particularly those related with altitude, than by landrace. Still, landraces are extensively used by agronomists, who recognize them as stable and discriminatory categories for the classiﬁcation of samples. In order to investigate the genomic foundation of maize landraces, we analyzed genomic data (35,909 SNPs from Illumina MaizeSNP50 BeadChip) obtained from 50 samples representing ﬁve maize landraces (Comiteco, Conejo, Tehua, Zapalote Grande, and Zapalote Chico), and searched for markers suitable for landrace assignment. Landrace clusters could not be identiﬁed taking all the genomic information, but they become manifest taking only a subset of SNPs with high FST among landraces. Discriminant analysis of principal components was conducted to classify samples using SNP data. Two classiﬁcation analyses were done, ﬁrst classifying samples by landrace and then by altitude category. Through this classiﬁcation method, we identiﬁed 20 landrace-informative SNPs and 14 altitude-informative SNPs, with only 6 SNPs in common for both analyses. These results show that Mexican maize phenotypic diversity can be classiﬁed in landraces using a small number of genomic markers, given the fact that landrace genomic diversity is inﬂuenced by environmental factors as well as artiﬁcial selection due to bio-cultural practices.},

We found complex hierarchical genetic structure created by altitude, dispersal events, and admixture among subspecies, which complicated identiﬁcation of locally beneﬁcial alleles.

	abstract = {Climate is predicted to change over the 21st century. However, little is known about how climate change can affect soil phosphorus (P) cycle and availability in global terrestrial ecosystems, where P is a key limiting nutrient. With a global database of Hedley P fractions and key associated physiochemical properties of 760 (semi-natural) natural soils compiled from 96 published studies, this study evaluated how climate pattern affected soil P cycle and availability in global terrestrial ecosystems. Overall, soil available P, indexed by Hedley labile inorganic P fraction, significantly decreased with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP). Hypothesis-oriented path model analysis suggests that MAT negatively affected soil available P mainly by decreasing soil organic P and primary mineral P and increasing soil sand content. MAP negatively affected soil available P both directly and indirectly through decreasing soil primary mineral P; however, these negative effects were offset by the positive effects of MAP on soil organic P and fine soil particles, resulting in a relatively minor total MAP effect on soil available P. As aridity degree was mainly determined by MAP, aridity also had a relatively minor total effect on soil available P. These global patterns generally hold true irrespective of soil depth (≤ 10 cm or {\textgreater} 10 cm) or site aridity index (≤ 1.0 or {\textgreater} 1.0), and were also true for the low-sand (≤ 50\%) soils. In contrast, available P of the high-sand ({\textgreater} 50\%) soils was positively affected by MAT and aridity and negatively affected by MAP. Our results suggest that temperature and precipitation have contrasting effects on soil P availability and can interact with soil particle size to control soil P availability.},

	abstract = {We developed a comprehensive, gridded Global Soil Dataset for use in Earth System Models (GSDE) and other applications. The GSDE provides soil information, such as soil particle-size distribution, organic carbon, and nutrients, and quality control information in terms of conﬁdence level at 3000 3 3000 horizontal resolution and for eight vertical layers to a depth of 2.3 m. The GSDE is based on the Soil Map of the World and various regional and national soil databases, including soil attribute data and soil maps. We used a standardized data structure and data processing procedures to harmonize the data collected from various sources. We then used a soil type linkage method (i.e., taxotransfer rules) and a polygon linkage method to derive the spatial distribution of the soil properties. To aggregate the attributes of different compositions of a mapping unit, we used three mapping approaches: the area-weighting method, the dominant soil type method, and the dominant binned soil attribute method. The data set can also be aggregated to a lower resolution. In this paper, we only show the vertical and horizontal variations of sand, silt and clay contents, bulk density, and soil organic carbon as examples of the GSDE. The GSDE estimates of global soil organic carbon stock to the depths of 2.3, 1, and 0.3 m are 1922.7, 1455.4, and 720.1 Gt, respectively. This newly developed data set provides more accurate soil information and represents a step forward to advance earth system modeling.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the distribution of fitness effects among newly arising mutations in the human genome is key to resolving important debates in medical and evolutionary genetics. Here, we present a method for inferring this distribution using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from a population with non-stationary demographic history (such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein codinggenes in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans) allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27–29\% of amino acid changing (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral ({\textbar}s{\textbar},0.01\%), 30–42\% are moderately deleterious (0.01\%,{\textbar}s{\textbar},1\%), and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal ({\textbar}s{\textbar}.1\%). Our results are consistent with 10–20\% of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our analysis also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome association mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype may be missed by this widely used approach for mapping genes underlying complex traits.},

	abstract = {Demographic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans for selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus, two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, and admixture. We model human expansion out of Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by the Environmental Genome Project. We infer divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years ago (95\% confidence interval: 40–270 kya). This is earlier than other genetic studies, in part because we incorporate migration. We estimate the European (CEU) and East Asian (CHB) divergence time to be 23 kya (95\% c.i.: 17–43 kya), long after archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally, we estimate divergence between East Asians (CHB) and Mexican-Americans (MXL) of 22 kya (95\% c.i.: 16.3–26.9 kya), and our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration. Furthermore, combining our demographic model with a previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).},

	abstract = {Many aspects of the historical relationships between populations in a species are reflected in genetic data. Inferring these relationships from genetic data, however, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a statistical model for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in multiple populations. In our model, the sampled populations in a species are related to their common ancestor through a graph of ancestral populations. Using genome-wide allele frequency data and a Gaussian approximation to genetic drift, we infer the structure of this graph. We applied this method to a set of 55 human populations and a set of 82 dog breeds and wild canids. In both species, we show that a simple bifurcating tree does not fully describe the data; in contrast, we infer many migration events. While some of the migration events that we find have been detected previously, many have not. For example, in the human data, we infer that Cambodians trace approximately 16\% of their ancestry to a population ancestral to other extant East Asian populations. In the dog data, we infer that both the boxer and basenji trace a considerable fraction of their ancestry (9\% and 25\%, respectively) to wolves subsequent to domestication and that East Asian toy breeds (the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese) result from admixture between modern toy breeds and ‘‘ancient’’ Asian breeds.

Phosphatestarved plants utilize their membrane phospholipids as a major source for internal phosphate supply by replacing phospholipids in their membranes with the non-phosphorus galactolipid, digalactosyldiacylglycerol. This membrane lipid remodeling has drawn much attention as a model of metabolic switching from phospholipids to the galactolipid. In the past decade, a considerable effort has been devoted to unraveling the molecular biology of this phenomenon. This review thus aims to summarize recent achievements with a focus on metabolic pathways during lipid remodeling.},

Yet many studies have not demonstrated local adaptation, suggesting that sometimes native populations are no better adapted than are genotypes from foreign environments. Local adaptation may also lead to trade-offs, in which adaptation to one environment comes at a cost of adaptation to another environment. I conducted a survey of published studies of local adaptation to quantify its frequency and magnitude and the costs associated with local adaptation. I also quantiﬁed the relationship between local adaptation and environmental differences and the relationship between local adaptation and phenotypic divergence. The overall frequency of local adaptation was 0.71, and the magnitude of the native population advantage in relative ﬁtness was 45\%. Divergence between home site environments was positively associated with the magnitude of local adaptation, but phenotypic divergence was not. I found a small negative correlation between a population’s relative ﬁtness in its native environment and its ﬁtness in a foreign environment, indicating weak trade-offs associated with local adaptation. These results suggest that populations are often locally adapted but stochastic processes such as genetic drift may limit the efﬁcacy of divergent selection.},

Whilst large amounts of P-fertilizers are thus used in agricultural production systems, they are a considerable cost factor, and the runoff of excessive P causes environmental damage. Moreover, global P-reserves may last for only several more generations. Cutting down on the use of P-fertilizers therefore is important, and to ultimately do so it is crucial to understand how plants sense, signal, respond to and cope with P-limitation, to determine the genes and molecular mechanisms involved, and to apply the knowledge to improve P-acquisition and P-use efficiency (PAE, PUE) of crop plant species. This chapter provides an overview of the players involved in plant P-status signalling/sensing, and outlines the approaches used to increase PAE/PUE on the basis of understanding the plant P-starvation response and the underlying signalling pathways and networks.},

Additionally, we introduce an alternative marker weighting that takes allelic associations (LD: linkage disequilibrium) into account, and apply this weighting to several estimators. In a simulation study, we show that improved estimators are obtained (1) by optimal weighting of markers, (2) by taking physical contiguity of genome into account, and (3) by weighting on the basis of LD.},

The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979–2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.},

One, Starch Grain and Phytolith Evidence for Early Ninth Millennium B.P. Maize from the Central Balsas River Valley, Mexico (1), focuses on the microevidence for domestic plant use from tools and surrounding soils beginning ≈8700 B.P. The second paper, Preceramic Human Occupation of the Central Balsas River Valley, Mexico: Cultural Context of Early Domesticated Maize and Squash (2), provides the contextual information of the site and region from which these important data were uncovered. The strata, artifacts, sediments, and microbotanical evidence firmly points toward the domestication of both maize and squash occurring between 8,990 and 8,610 cal. B.P. in Mexico, perhaps even from that region of Mesoamerica, for these are the earliest dates yet recorded for maize. That these remains have been found in the ostensible homeland of the wild progenitor of maize further solidifies the thesis that this region in Guerrero was the probable locus of maize domestication.

It is curious that with so much interest in the topic of plant domestication in archaeology, geography, and botany, it took until 2005 to include this region of Mexico in our search for the roots of domestication. This investigatory blind spot is most probably because visible early plant evidence was uncovered in dry conditions. Following the data, scholars pursued domestication where they could easily find the evidence, ignoring the regions where the interactions were more likely to occur. For years people have been looking in the higher, drier Mexican altiplano for evidence of maize domestication and early use, in part, because of the spectacular evidence uncovered …

	abstract = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods—random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression—as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10–fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56\% (coarse fragments) and 83\% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61\%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230\%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Phosphorus (P) is a major element required for biological activity in terrestrial ecosystems. Although the total P content in most soils can be large, only a small fraction is available or in an organic form for biological utilization because it is bound either in incompletely weathered mineral particles, adsorbed on mineral surfaces, or, over the time of soil formation, made unavailable by secondary mineral formation (occluded). In order to adequately represent phosphorus availability in global biogeochemistry–climate models, a representation of the amount and form of P in soils globally is required. We develop an approach that builds on existing knowledge of soil P processes and databases of parent material and soil P measurements to provide spatially explicit estimates of different forms of naturally occurring soil P on the global scale. We assembled data on the various forms of phosphorus in soils globally, chronosequence information, and several global spatial databases to develop a map of total soil P and the distribution among mineral bound, labile, organic, occluded, and secondary P forms in soils globally. The amount of P, to 50cm soil depth, in soil labile, organic, occluded, and secondary pools is 3.6 ± 3, 8.6 ± 6, 12.2 ± 8, and 3.2 ± 2 Pg P (Petagrams of P, 1 Pg = 1 × 10$^{\textrm{15}}$g) respectively. The amount in soil mineral particles to the same depth is estimated at 13.0 ± 8 Pg P for a global soil total of 40.6 ± 18 Pg P. The large uncertainty in our estimates reflects our limited understanding of the processes controlling soil P transformations during pedogenesis and a deficiency in the number of soil P measurements. In spite of the large uncertainty, the estimated global spatial variation and distribution of different soil P forms presented in this study will be useful for global biogeochemistry models that include P as a limiting element in biological production by providing initial estimates of the available soil P for plant uptake and microbial utilization.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However these analyses frequently assume that the participating individuals or animals are mutually unrelated which may not be the case in large samples, leading to erroneous conclusions. In order to retain as much data as possible while minimizing the risk of false positives it is useful to identify a large subset of relatively unrelated individuals in the population. This can be done using a heuristic for finding a large set of independent of nodes in an undirected graph. We describe a fast randomized heuristic for this purpose. The same methodology can also be used for identifying a suitable set of markers for analyzing population stratification, and other instances where a rapid heuristic for maximal independent sets in large graphs is needed.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely used to map loci contributing to variation in complex traits and risk of diseases in humans. Accurate specification of familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized) family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption is often untenable., Results: Here, we present a rapid algorithm for relationship inference using high-throughput genotype data typical of GWAS that allows the presence of unknown population substructure. The relationship of any pair of individuals can be precisely inferred by robust estimation of their kinship coefficient, independent of sample composition or population structure (sample invariance). We present simulation experiments to demonstrate that the algorithm has sufficient power to provide reliable inference on millions of unrelated pairs and thousands of relative pairs (up to 3rd-degree relationships). Application of our robust algorithm to HapMap and GWAS datasets demonstrates that it performs properly even under extreme population stratification, while algorithms assuming a homogeneous population give systematically biased results. Our extremely efficient implementation performs relationship inference on millions of pairs of individuals in a matter of minutes, dozens of times faster than the most efficient existing algorithm known to us., Availability: Our robust relationship inference algorithm is implemented in a freely available software package, KING, available for download at http://people.virginia.edu/∼wc9c/KING., Contact: wmchen@virginia.edu, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) deﬁciency is a major constraint for maize production in many low-input agroecosystems. This study was conducted to evaluate genotypic variation in both root (root architecture and morphology, including root hairs) and plant growth traits associated with the adaptation of maize landraces to a P-deﬁcient Andisol in two locations in the Central Mexican highlands. Two hundred and forty-two accessions from the Purhepecha Plateau, Michoacan were grown in Ponzomaran with low (23 kg P2O5 ha−1) and high (97 kg P2O5 ha−1) P fertilization under rain-fed ﬁeld conditions, and subsequently a subset of 50 contrasting accessions were planted in the succeeding crop cycle in Bonilla. Accessions differed greatly in plant growth, root morphology and P efﬁciency deﬁned as growth with suboptimal P availability. The accessions were divided into 3 categories of P efﬁciency using principal component and cluster analyses, and 4 categories according to the retained principal component and their relative weight for each genotype in combination with growth or yield potential. The distribution of accessions among three phosphorus efﬁciency classes was stable across locations. Phosphorus-efﬁcient accessions had greater biomass, root to shoot ratio, nodal rooting, nodal root laterals, and nodal root hair density and length of nodal root main axis, and ﬁrst-order laterals under P deﬁciency. Biomass allocation to roots, as quantiﬁed by the allometric partitioning coefﬁcient (K) was not altered by P availability in the efﬁcient accessions, but inefﬁcient accessions had a lower K under low P conditions. Accessions with enhanced nodal rooting and laterals had greater growth under low P. Dense root hairs on nodal root main axes and ﬁrst-order laterals conferred a marked beneﬁt under low P, as evidenced by increased plant biomass. Late maturity improved growth and yield under low P. These results indicate that landraces of the Central Mexican highlands exhibit variation for several root traits that may be useful for genetic improvement of P efﬁciency in maize.},

Improved crops that acquire and use P more efﬁciently are a sustainable solution to increase crop yield in these systems. This study determined the contribution of P acquisition efﬁciency (PAE) and P utilization efﬁciency (PUTE) in determining P use efﬁciency (PUE) of 20 maize accessions from the Purhepecha Plateau, Michoacan, grown on a P-deﬁcient Andisol, at two locations with low (23 kg P2O5 ha−1) and high (97 kg P2O5 ha−1) P fertilization under rain-fed conditions. Under P deﬁciency conditions in the acid soil, both PAE and PUTE were important factors explaining the variation in P use efﬁciency at both P levels. Greater P use efﬁciency was related to an improved distribution of dry matter in the plants and a lower absorbed P allocated in the grain. Low grain P concentrations at maturity were not associated with reductions in grain yield, nor were they signiﬁcantly correlated to HI, suggesting that exploiting genotypic variation for this trait may be productive. The study identiﬁed genetic variation among maize landraces in their response of PUTE. On a P-deﬁcient acidic soil, accessions CB-2, DP × Tromba, HV313 × DEM, Macho III-04, and CIMMYT-1, were categorized as the most P efﬁcient and the most responsive to increased P availability. In contrast, late maturing P-efﬁcient accessions SHUI-2, CB-2, AS-4, and ZR-6 showed the greatest variation for P uptake under low P conditions. Late maturity improved growth and yield in low P soils. These accessions expressed the desired traits for PUE, which may be exploited in breeding efforts.},

Modern highland maize and mexicana share multiple phenotypic traits, prompting the hypothesis that maize adaptation to the highland niche was facilitated by hybridization with mexicana and subsequent acquisition of adaptive genetic variation. The use of high density molecular markers has revealed the extent of gene ﬂow from mexicana to Mexican highland maize to be from 2 to 10\%, and opened the door to the mapping of regions of introgression within the genome. To assess the importance of regions of mexicana introgression to ﬁtness and agronomic traits in highland maize, QTL mapping was performed in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross of the highland landrace Palomero Toluqueño, an ancient highland landrace with one of the highest levels of mexicana introgression, and B73, an inbred line adapted to low elevations in the US mid-west. The RIL population was evaluated in lowland (Valle de Banderas, Nayarit) and highland (Metepec, Estado de Mexico) ﬁeld sites. Twenty one QTLs were identiﬁed for adaptive traits and ﬂowering architecture and co-localized with mexicana introgression, however there was an overlap only on chromosomes 4 and 9 for ear diameter and tassel length. Development of heterologous inbred families (HIF) for the introgression region inv4m on chromosome 4 identiﬁed an effect of this region on male and female ﬂoral architecture closely related with the genetic background indicating epistatic interactions with other loci in the genome.},

	abstract = {Background: High density genotyping data are indispensable for genomic analyses of complex traits in animal and crop species. Maize is one of the most important crop plants worldwide, however a high density SNP genotyping array for analysis of its large and highly dynamic genome was not available so far.
Results: We developed a high density maize SNP array composed of 616,201 variants (SNPs and small indels). Initially, 57 M variants were discovered by sequencing 30 representative temperate maize lines and then stringently filtered for sequence quality scores and predicted conversion performance on the array resulting in the selection of 1.2 M polymorphic variants assayed on two screening arrays. To identify high-confidence variants, 285 DNA samples from a broad genetic diversity panel of worldwide maize lines including the samples used for sequencing, important founder lines for European maize breeding, hybrids, and proprietary samples with European, US, semi-tropical, and tropical origin were used for experimental validation. We selected 616 k variants according to their performance during validation, support of genotype calls through sequencing data, and physical distribution for further analysis and for the design of the commercially available Affymetrix® Axiom® Maize Genotyping Array. This array is composed of 609,442 SNPs and 6,759 indels. Among these are 116,224 variants in coding regions and 45,655 SNPs of the Illumina® MaizeSNP50 BeadChip for study comparison. In a subset of 45,974 variants, apart from the target SNP additional off-target variants are detected, which show only a minor bias towards intermediate allele frequencies. We performed principal coordinate and admixture analyses to determine the ability of the array to detect and resolve population structure and investigated the extent of LD within a worldwide validation panel.
Conclusions: The high density Affymetrix® Axiom® Maize Genotyping Array is optimized for European and American temperate maize and was developed based on a diverse sample panel by applying stringent quality filter criteria to ensure its suitability for a broad range of applications. With 600 k variants it is the largest currently publically available genotyping array in crop species.},

Quantitative Trait Locus mapping identified a small number of loci linked to traits characteristic of Mexican highland maize.,Although there was no strong evidence to associate quantitative trait loci with regions of introgression, we nonetheless identified many Mexican highland alleles of introgressed origin that carry potentially functional sequence variants. The impact of introgression on stress tolerance and yield in the highland environment remains to be fully characterized.},
